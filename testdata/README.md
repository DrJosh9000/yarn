`.yarn` and `.testplan` files in this directory were copied from the
[Yarn Spinner TestCases directory](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/tree/develop/Tests/TestCases).
`.yarnc` and `.csv` files in this directory were generated from the `.yarn`
files using `ysc compile`, with a version of the
[Yarn Spinner Console](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Console)
built with a 2.0 beta of Yarn Spinner.

The files in this directory are therefore either copyright Secret Lab Pty. Ltd.
and Yarn Spinner contributors, or derivative works. The original copyright
